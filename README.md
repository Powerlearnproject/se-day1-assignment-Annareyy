#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the act of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining high-quality software.The importance of software engineering technology industry includes:
. It ensures that the systems are efficient hence an organization makes the most of their technolgy investment.
. Enabling the creation of applications and sofwares that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce,entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) â€“ NATO hosted the first conference on software engineering, recognising the need of structured development approaches.

The introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1970s-1980s) OOP revolutionised program design by fostering code reuse and modularity.

The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced Agile techniques, which emphasise iterative development and customer participation above inflexible processes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- At this phase the users needs and system requirements are gathered and documented.
2. Design- creating designs of the software's architecture and user inteface.
3. Implementaion - writing of code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing- the sotware functionality and standards are tested to check whether they are met.
5. Deployment- Releasing the software to production.
6. Maintenance- At this phase the users and cutsomers get suport,updates and software enhaements after deloyment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential aproach with distinct phases for example a bridge while Agie methodoology is an iterative & instrumental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change for example a mobile app like mpesa app which is frequently updated.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software deveoper is resposible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing the systems functionalities or components before it is pushed to production to ensure it meets specific standards and functional requirements.
Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the project plans, timelines,resource allocationn and execution.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ntegrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide essential tools for writing, debugging, and testing code such as Visual Studio Code while Version Control Systems (VCS): Facilitate team collaboration by tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members such as Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines can be ovecomed by breaking down the development process to bits and creating a schedule as to when each part should be completed to ensure deadline is met.
Technical debt can be overcomed by practising proper code implentatios and avoiding shortcuts.
Security risks can be overcomed by implementig secure code reviews and audits.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual components or functions of a software.
Intergartion testing is the testing that ensures combined modules or components work together.
System testing is wheeby a system is tested as a whole.
Acceptance testing is the testing of software against user's requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting questions or statements to obtain the most accurate and relevant responses from an AI. It is important because well-structured prompts help AI models generate precise and meaningful outputs by ensuring clarity and specificity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Answer this.
Clear - Answer the above questions in context to the file uploaded. Make it clear and precise. This is improved since the AI model will ensure the answers are in accordance to the document provided and they will be more clear and precise.
